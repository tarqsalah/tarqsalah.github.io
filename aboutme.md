subtitle: Hydrology, Groundwater extremes, Date science

I am an early career hydrologist interested in the relationship between water, people and the environment. My research focuses on groundwater extremes (droughts and floods) and uses data-driven methods to understand hydrological processes and their interaction with climate variability and anthropogenic change. Currently, I am investigating drought risks in groundwater systems across the Irish region.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy connecting with people, exploring the outdoors, and engaging in community initiatives.

### My story

Originally from Sudan, I spent my early years in Saudi Arabia, where I began my elementary education before returning to Sudan to pursue a degree in engineering at the University of Khartoum. Today, I am advancing my academic journey with a Master of Philosophy in Hydrology at Technological University Dublin. my journey reflects a commitment to lifelong learning and making a difference.

When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll find me volunteering to help junior students, hiking, playing football, swimming, or reading poetry. I believe that combining curiosity, collaboration, and creativity can help shape a more sustainable and resilient future.
